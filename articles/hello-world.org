#+Description: Want to know more about how Onepunch Technologies was started?

* Hello World :history:

We are excited to announce our launch of our new company and website. We created Onepunch Technologies Inc. to increase the marginal utility of software engineering. What in the world does that mean?
It means that we are not just aiming to be another dev shop. We are aiming to provide an order of magnitude of increased value to the world through software.

My name is Michael Whitehead. I am the founder of Onepunch Technologies Inc. and the author of this post.
My professional career started when I dropped out of college due to some financial complications.
There wasn't a way to continue to pay for college, but a startup I was working for on the side was willing to hire me.
Unfortunately the startup failed, and while there were some issues with marketing and sales, I didn't focus on that part because that was out of my control.
As I was the lead developer any technical failures were my fault. I took those failures personally.
Almost no other thing in my life has driven me as much as those failures.
I have dedicated the rest of my software career to finding solutions to those failures.
As it turns out I've found solutions not just for myself, but for the software industry too.

** Where the idea for Onepunch Technologies came from
A few years ago I would often find my self day dreaming about an app that could solve a problem for me.
Then I would think about the amount of effort, time, and or money it would require to build it.
If I were to add up all the app ideas and try to work on them all, then I would have to spend a few lifetimes on them.
I thought of trying to play the startup game, find some investors, raise a few million dollars, build a mediocre app, and hopefully after about ten miserable years have enough money from a pitiful exit to try and do it again.
It was very tempting to buy into the game, but I decided to take a different approach.

I started to look at software the same way I would look at an investment.
What is it about our current software practices that cause good returns? What causes a bad return?.
I poored over economic books to find any applicable insights.
This is on top of all the technical books and papers I devoured.
I soon found some insights by analyzing software the same way an economist analyzes a capital good.
For example a tractor revolusionized the farming industry which led to many other advancements in our world.
Looking at the world as it is today, what would be the next leap in technology? Where is the next tractor?

** Onepunch Technologies is born
It is hard for me to imagine a better name for what we are trying to accomplish.
We are looking to do two things. 1. defeat your software problems with a single punch and 2. when we defeat your software problems they stay defeated.
We want to build software quickly, that is to say in one punch.
But it isn't enough to build software quickly.
There already exist lots of methods of creating software quickly, but they all have the same problem of maintenance cost.
As Uncle Bob says "We know that maintenance is 90% of the software lifecycle, and 90% of the cost".

Onepunch Technologies is the thing we are building that will build all the other things. It will build them fast, and build them well.
